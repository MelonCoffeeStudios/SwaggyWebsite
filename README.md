SwaggyWebsite
=============

My soon to be new website :D

I don't know why I am creating this, buuuut my current website needs a good overhaul. So I thought that I would follow on with the trend and create a Metro themed website with a more responsive CSS design. I plan to intergrate the coolest and most awesome things I can, making them from scratch if I can.

This sites intention will mainly be to document my skills as a developer and designer.

So lets see where it goes :D

Changelog
==========

V1.00
------

Take a guess what happened in this version?
Yep. Damn right!
- General layout completed
- Some useful classes generated by JS
- I found out about the "transition" thingy in CSS so that's in there :D
- I think that's it?

Installation
========
If your viewing this on GitHub then I'm going to assume that you know how to open up a website. 

I shall say that the website does not use and server-side scripts (yet) but it does require an active internet connection :)
